      <h1>About Devscribe</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Hi üëã I'm <strong>Avinash</strong> ‚Äî a developer who wanted to make
        documenting, visualizing, and experimenting with software simpler and
        more human. Devscribe is something I started alone, out of curiosity and
        love for clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>üå± Why Devscribe Exists</h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve spent years juggling different tools ‚Äî editors, API testers,
        diagram apps, and documentation platforms ‚Äî just to explain an idea
        clearly. It always felt unnecessarily complex. Every change meant
        jumping between five windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Devscribe was born to solve that frustration ‚Äî a single place to
        **write, visualize, and execute code**. It‚Äôs not a company or a startup;
        it‚Äôs a personal effort to build something useful, clean, and calm.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to build a product. I wanted to build something I wish I
        had while learning, teaching, and creating software.‚Äù
      </blockquote>

      <h2>üí° My Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Devscribe‚Äôs goal is simple ‚Äî to help developers focus on what truly
        matters:
        <em>thinking and building</em>. Every feature, from diagrams to live
        code execution, is built with simplicity and purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope it saves you time, sparks creativity, and makes documentation
        something you actually enjoy doing.
      </p>

      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Made by One, Growing with Many</h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm building Devscribe on my own ‚Äî design, code, and content. But I
        don‚Äôt want it to stay that way. If you love developer tools, clean
        design, or good ideas, your help is welcome!
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>üé® Help improve the UI or visual design</li>
        <li>üíª Suggest new features or refine existing ones</li>
        <li>üß† Share your feedback, ideas, or use-cases</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you‚Äôre a designer, developer, or just someone who cares about making
        good tools ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear from you.
      </p>

      <h2>üì¨ How to Reach Me</h2>
      <p>
        You can write to me directly at
        <a href="mailto:hello@devscribe.app">hello@devscribe.app</a>

      <p>
        I read every message personally. Whether it‚Äôs a small suggestion or a
        big idea ‚Äî it matters. Together, we can make Devscribe a space where
        developers think, create, and document beautifully.
